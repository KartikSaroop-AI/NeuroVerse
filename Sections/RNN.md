## ⚙️ Experiment 1 – MNIST Classification (Baseline)
A fully connected neural network trained on MNIST to establish a baseline for comparison with RNN-based models.  

🎯 **Goal:** Understand data representation without sequential modeling.

## ⚙️ Experiment 2 – TensorFlow Callbacks (EarlyStopping & ModelCheckpoint)
Implemented callback functions to optimize training efficiency and prevent overfitting.  

🎯 **Goal:** Use EarlyStopping and ModelCheckpoint in TensorFlow/Keras.
